# Security Project: Key Management through certificates

## Description
This project aims to simulate the sending/receiving process of a message between two parties that use X509 digital certificates. It contains the implementation of the following:
⋅⋅* X509 Certificate
⋅⋅* Certificate Authority using **MongoDB** database
⋅⋅* ElGamal Digital Signature Algorithm
⋅⋅* RSA Algorithm
⋅⋅* A test drive that contains the simulation of the process. The first party that sends is called Alice, and the second party that receives is called Bob
